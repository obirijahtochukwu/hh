      'Paleontologists have excavated more bones from a site near Grande Prairie, Alta., that will help provide a glimpse into how dinosaurs behaved when they roamed the earth.  In mid-June, researchers discovered the juvenile hip bone of a Pachyrhinosaurus, along with some vertebrae, ribs and foot bones, in the Pipestone Creek bonebed south of Wembley.  At the time of that discovery, the researchers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â from the Philip J. Currie Dinosaur Museum in Wembley, Alta., 24 kilometres west of Grande Prairie ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â had been working to excavate a Pachyrhinosaurus femur, two lower leg bones and a partial juvenile skull that had been uncovered late in the 2021 excavation season.  The fossils provide a snapshot into the lives of Pachyrhinosaurus, a horned four-legged dinosaur that resembled a rhinoceros. Instead of a horn like Triceratops, a distant relative, it had a big bony bump on its nose.  "Everything we know about their behaviour, we know from fossils," museum curator Emily Bamforth, who was part of the research team, told CBC\'s Edmonton AM on Wednesday. Areas like bonebeds give us a really good indication of how these animals were living together, what their herding behaviour might have been, what their social structures might have been, how they were living, how they were dying.',
